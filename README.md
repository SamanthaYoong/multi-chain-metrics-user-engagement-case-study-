# Case Study: Enhancing Multi-Chain User Engagement & Search Experience for Bitget Wallet

## üåê‚õìÔ∏è Background  
Bitget Wallet is a leading non-custodial crypto wallet supporting 130+ blockchains, millions of tokens, and 80 million users globally. Despite its extensive feature set ‚Äî including swaps, staking, rewards, DApp exploration, and multi-chain trading ‚Äî challenges remain in understanding and optimizing user engagement, especially around search behaviors and multi-chain trading funnels.

## üåê‚õìÔ∏è Objective  
Build a business-reflective metrics system and develop data-driven insights to:  
- Monitor user behavior and identify friction points in multi-chain trading and search features.  
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve user engagement, retention, and transaction completion.  
- Support product and marketing teams with thematic analyses to align roadmap priorities with user needs.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Methodology

### Metrics System Design & Implementation  
- Collaborated with product and engineering teams to define key metrics aligned with business goals:  
  - Daily active users (DAU) by chain and feature (swap, staking, DApp usage)  
  - Transaction funnel conversion rates for multi-chain swaps and cross-chain bridges  
  - User search success rates, search-to-action conversion, and drop-offs  
  - Security-related metrics including flagged suspicious transactions and wallet recovery incidents  
- Developed SQL-based data pipelines aggregating event-level logs from blockchain nodes, user devices, and API interactions  
- Built dashboards in Tableau for real-time business monitoring and anomaly detection

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on User Search Behavior  
- Analyzed millions of user search queries to understand popular tokens, failed searches, and search abandonment patterns  
- Segmented users by activity level, blockchain preference, and geographical region to detect differing search habits  
- Identified that over 18% of searches failed due to missing token metadata or UI misalignments

### Thematic Deep Dive: Multi-Chain Swap Funnel  
- Mapped the user journey from initiating a swap, selecting source and destination chains, to transaction confirmation  
- Discovered a 25% drop-off rate at the token approval step, correlated with longer wait times due to chain congestion  
- Cross-referenced with user support tickets and found frustration spikes aligned with these bottlenecks

### Actionable Recommendations & Implementation Support  
- Recommended UI/UX improvements: preload commonly searched tokens and chains, implement dynamic token metadata updates  
- Proposed introducing retry logic and clearer messaging during token approval delays to reduce drop-offs  
- Collaborated with product managers to prioritize search feature overhaul and enhance multi-chain swap reliability  
- Presented insights and KPIs weekly to stakeholders, ensuring alignment and tracking impact post-implementation

## ‚õìÔ∏è Impact & Results  
- **Search Success Rate Improvement:** Reduced failed search rate from 18% to under 8% within 3 months post feature rollout  
- **Multi-Chain Swap Conversion:** Increased swap completion rate by 15%, improving transaction volume by millions of dollars monthly  
- **User Engagement:** DAU on swap and staking features grew by 12% quarter-over-quarter, contributing to wallet‚Äôs revenue growth  
- **Security Monitoring:** Developed baseline metrics for suspicious activity, helping the security team proactively protect user assets backed by the $300M protection fund

## ‚õìÔ∏è Tools & Skills Applied  
- SQL for data extraction and complex event log aggregation  
- Tableau for data visualization and dashboard creation  
- Statistical analysis and segmentation to understand user cohorts  
- Cross-functional collaboration with engineering, product, and security teams  
- Clear business reporting and data storytelling for executive-level decision making
